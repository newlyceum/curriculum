# Homeschool Resources

UPDATED FOR 2018-2019. This document is a starting point for organizing homeschool resources. *([2017] indicates we used it in 2017-2018. I removed stuff we ended up not using.)*

## Summer 2018

* Jack published an article in the [Montpelier Bridge](http://www.montpelierbridge.com/)'s Summer Breeze issue in 2017. The deadline for this year's issue—Young Vermont—is June 29 (with additional review time requested for younger writers).
* Games, Games, Games day camp at River Rock School
* Swimming Lessons in Montpelier
* [Little River History Trail](https://www.vtstateparks.com/assets/pdf/little-river-trails.pdf) meetups?
* Groton State Forest meetups? ([Boulder Beach](https://vtstateparks.com/boulder.html) swimming, [hiking trails](https://www.vtstateparks.com/assets/pdf/groton_trails.pdf))

## For 2018-2019:

* *Encourage Jack to do [Vermont History Day](http://vermonthistory.org/educate/vermont-history-day).*
* [Audubon](http://vt.audubon.org/programs/homeschool-programs): Both kids in same age group in 2018-2019, we'll aim to do this more. [2017]
* Not sure if we can integrate these Junior Duck Stamp curricula, but they look intriguing:
  * [Curriculum](https://www.fws.gov/birds/education/junior-duck-stamp-conservation-program/conservation-education-curriculum.php)
  * [Homeschool Guide](https://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/pdf/education/JuniorDuckStamp-HomeschoolGuide.pdf)
* We'll be doing [Billings Farm](https://billingsfarm.org/education/homeschooler-days/) again [2017]
* Watch for [Thursday workshops at Pacem School](http://pacemschool.org/beyond-academics/thursday-workshops/) &ndash; 2017-2018 included cake decorating, tabletop game design
* We'll be doing [History for Homeschoolers](http://vermonthistory.org/educate/homeschool) again [2017]
* Meetups at [The Swimming Hole](https://theswimmingholestowe.com/) in Stowe? [First in Fitness](http://www.firstinfitness.com/pool-schedule) in Berlin?
* Field trip to [Greenspark Sustainability Park](http://greensparkvt.com/)?

Work on structure & scheduling, talk about [Maker vs. Manager](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

Can we do more deep dive project-based learning? What topics/interests/goals?

I got Jack a copy of Susan Cain's [Quiet Power](https://www.bearpondbooks.com/book/9780803740600), the kids' & teens' version of Quiet, because managing energy is important for introverts.
