# Homeschool Resources

UPDATED FOR 2018-2019. This document is a starting point for organizing homeschool resources. *([2017] indicates we used it in 2017-2018. I removed stuff we ended up not using.)*

## For 2018-2019: Start in the fall:

* *Encourage Jack to do [Vermont History Day](http://vermonthistory.org/educate/vermont-history-day).*
* [Audubon](http://vt.audubon.org/programs/homeschool-programs): Both kids in same age group, we'll aim to do this more. [2017]
* Not sure if we can integrate these Junior Duck Stamp curricula, but they look intriguing:
  * [Curriculum](https://www.fws.gov/birds/education/junior-duck-stamp-conservation-program/conservation-education-curriculum.php)
  * [Homeschool Guide](https://www.fws.gov/migratorybirds/pdf/education/JuniorDuckStamp-HomeschoolGuide.pdf)
* We'll be doing [Billings Farm](https://billingsfarm.org/education/homeschooler-days/) again [2017]
* Watch for Thursday workshops at Pacem School &ndash; 2017-2018 included cake decorating, tabletop game design
* We'll be doing History for Homeschoolers again [2017]
* Meetups at [The Swimming Hole](https://theswimmingholestowe.com/) in Stowe?

Work on structure & scheduling, talk about [Maker vs. Manager](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

Can we do more deep dive project-based learning? What topics/interests/goals?
