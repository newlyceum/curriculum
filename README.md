## Our Approach

Unschooling with curriculum.

Neil Postman's prescription in *Technocracy* to teach "the ascent of humanity," incorporating the history of how we got to where we are in all subjects and our collective accomplishments as a common, unifying thread.

## Compliance / Core / Curriculum

We'll continue to use Oak Meadow as rubric and scaffolding for **some of** our lessons.
